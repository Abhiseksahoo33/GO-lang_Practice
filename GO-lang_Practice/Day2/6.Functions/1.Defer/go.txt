This txt file is used in GO-lang_Practice\Day2\6.Functions\1.Defer\3.defer.go file to see the contents of the file.

Explanation:

file, err := os.Open(filename) opens the file in read-only mode.
If there's an error, print it and return from the function.
Defer file closure:

defer file.Close() schedules the file.Close() function to be called automatically when the surrounding function (main) returns or panics. This ensures proper resource cleanup even in case of errors.
